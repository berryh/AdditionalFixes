# Additional Fixes
This is a mod containing fixes for the Enigmatica 8 modpack, which is based on Minecraft 1.18. There are a few places where either a mod should be updated or where there's no update available yet, but the bugs hindered gameplay. So, this mod contains fixes for some of those situations.

Please feel free to open an issue if you think you've found a situation that's suitable for this mod, but please include a reproduction scenario and use screenshots or video wherever possible.
